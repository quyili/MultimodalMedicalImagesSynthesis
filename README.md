# Synthesis of Registered Multimodal Medical Images with Lesions
This is a code demo for the study of 'Synthesis of Registered Multimodal Medical Images with Lesions'.

### Abstract
The collection and annotation of medical image data have always been a challenge in many data-driven medical image processing tasks, especially for registered multimodal medical image data. This can be effectively alleviated by utilizing the image synthesis technology. However, directly-synthesized medical images generated by current methods usually have unreasonable structures or contours and uncontrollable lesions. In this paper, we proposed a new method for the synthesis of registered multimodal medical images from a random normal distribution matrix based on the Generative Adversarial Networks. Besides, the corresponding lesions can be generated efficiently based on the selected lesion labels. We perform extensive validation experiments on multiple public datasets to comprehensively verify the effectiveness of synthetic lesions and the availability of synthetic data.Â The results show that our synthetic data can be used as pre-trained data or enhanced data in medical image intelligent processing tasks to greatly improve the generalization ability of the model.

### Datasets
BRATS2015(https://www.smir.ch/BRATS/Start2015)  includes registered T1, T2, T1c, Flair, 274 [155\*240\*240] MRIs per modality, and the correspoding tumor segmentation labels.

Kaggle Chest Xray(https://www.kaggle.com/paultimothymooney/chest-xray-pneumonia) includes 5863 positive Xray from size [384\*127] to [2772\*2304].

Kaggle Lung CT(https://www.kaggle.com/kmader/finding-lungs-in-ct-data/data/) includes 267 CT of transverse from lung, with a size of [512\*512].

DRIVE(http://www.isi.uu.nl/Research/Databases/DRIVE/) includes 20 [565\*584] color fundus retinal photos and corresponding retinal vascular segmentation annotations in both training set and test set.

FIRE(https://projects.ics.forth.gr/cvrl/fire/)includes 268 [2912\*2912] color fundus retinal photos.

TC Lung CT(https://tianchi.aliyun.com/competition/entrance/231724/information) includes 1470 [512\*512] 3D CT with detection label of 5 kinds of lesions. We only examined for pulmonary nodules.

We divided all 3D images to 2D sildes. All images are normalized and scaled to [512\*512].
